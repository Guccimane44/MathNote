# HPC note

### Motivation
The HPC communities have previously mistakenly assumed that as long as performance gains from hardware are possible, traditional simulation-based methods will continue to provide increased scientific insight. This insight has been challenged at a time when we can foresee the obsolescence of Moore's law. It is urgent to examine the methodological efficiency otherwise we may be reaching limits of both hardware and methodological performance gains.
