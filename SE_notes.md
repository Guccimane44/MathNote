### 4 issues that affect software
There are no universal software engineering methods or techniques that may be used. However,
there are four related issues that affect many different types of software:
* __Heterogeneity__ Increasingly, systems are required to operate as distributed sys-
tems across networks that include different types of computer and mobile
devices. As well as running on general-purpose computers, software may also
have to execute on mobile phones and tablets. You often have to integrate new
software with older legacy systems written in different programming languages.
The challenge here is to develop techniques for building dependable software
that is flexible enough to cope with this heterogeneity.
* __Business__ and social change Businesses and society are changing incredibly
quickly as emerging economies develop and new technologies become availa-
ble. They need to be able to change their existing software and to rapidly
develop new software. Many traditional software engineering techniques are
time consuming, and delivery of new systems often takes longer than planned.
They need to evolve so that the time required for software to deliver value to its
customers is reduced.
* __Security and trust__ As software is intertwined with all aspects of our lives, it is
essential that we can trust that software. This is especially true for remote soft-
ware systems accessed through a web page or web service interface. We have to
make sure that malicious users cannot successfully attack our software and that
information security is maintained.
* __Scale__ Software has to be developed across a very wide range of scales, from
very small embedded systems in portable or wearable devices through to
Internet-scale, cloud-based systems that serve a global community.
### Specialties about web-based systems
* __reuse__: often with framework
* __impossiable for previously planning__: Web-based systems are always developed and delivered incrementally.
* __service-oriented software engineering__
* __Interface__: like HTML5 or AJAX.
