# Chapter 1
### big 4 activities in SE
* __Software specification__ The functionality of the software and constraints on its
operation must be defined.
* __Software development__ The software to meet the specification must be produced.
* __Software validation__ The software must be validated to ensure that it does what
the customer wants.
* __Software evolution__ The software must evolve to meet changing customer needs.
### 4 issues that affect software
There are no universal software engineering methods or techniques that may be used. However,
there are four related issues that affect many different types of software:
* __Heterogeneity__ Increasingly, systems are required to operate as distributed sys-
tems across networks that include different types of computer and mobile
devices. As well as running on general-purpose computers, software may also
have to execute on mobile phones and tablets. You often have to integrate new
software with older legacy systems written in different programming languages.
The challenge here is to develop techniques for building dependable software
that is flexible enough to cope with this heterogeneity.
* __Business__ and social change Businesses and society are changing incredibly
quickly as emerging economies develop and new technologies become availa-
ble. They need to be able to change their existing software and to rapidly
develop new software. Many traditional software engineering techniques are
time consuming, and delivery of new systems often takes longer than planned.
They need to evolve so that the time required for software to deliver value to its
customers is reduced.
* __Security and trust__ As software is intertwined with all aspects of our lives, it is
essential that we can trust that software. This is especially true for remote soft-
ware systems accessed through a web page or web service interface. We have to
make sure that malicious users cannot successfully attack our software and that
information security is maintained.
* __Scale__ Software has to be developed across a very wide range of scales, from
very small embedded systems in portable or wearable devices through to
Internet-scale, cloud-based systems that serve a global community.
### Specialties about web-based systems
* __reuse__: often with framework
* __impossiable for previously planning__: Web-based systems are always developed and delivered incrementally.
* __service-oriented software engineering__
* __Interface__: like HTML5 or AJAX.

### Software process models
* __Waterfall model__: One part after another, good for projects where communication and flexibility aren't available.
* __Increment model__: Pros: fast, flexible, early delivery possible. Cons: The process is not visible. Managers need regular deliverables to measure pro-
gress. System structure tends to degrade as new increments are added.
* __Reuse-oriented software engineering__: Trend. good for: Stand-alone application; Collection of objects as a package; Web services with preexisted standards.
### Process Activities
Specification; Design and Implementation; Validation; Evolution
### Coping with changes
Two approaches to future changes.
* Change anticipation: giving prototype to customers and anticipate the potential changes.
* Change tolerance: the software itself is designed for easy-to-change.
##### Prototyping
A prototype is an early version of a software system that is used to demonstrate concepts, try out design options, and find out more about the problem and its possible
solutions.
##### Incremental delivery 
In an incremental delivery process, customers define which of the services are most important and which are least important to
them. A number of delivery increments are then defined, with each increment providing a subset of the system functionality.
