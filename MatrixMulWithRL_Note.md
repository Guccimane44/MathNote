## Motivation
Matrix multiplication algorithms can be formalized as low-rank decompositions of a specific three-dimensional tensor, called the matrix multiplication tensor.

## Terminologies
##### Exploration-Exploitation in RL: 
* The policy head helps the agent decide which action to take by sampling from the probability distribution. It introduces exploration as actions are selected with some randomness.
* The value head assists in the exploration-exploitation trade-off by providing an estimate of the expected value of being in the current state. This estimate guides the policy head to favor actions that are expected to lead to higher cumulative rewards.
