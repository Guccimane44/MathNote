### Logical Independence vs. Physical Independence

* Logical Independence: This refers to the ability to change the conceptual schema (the way data is perceived and organized at the logical level) without affecting the external schemas or the applications that interact with the database.
* Physical Independence: This refers to the ability to change the internal schema (the way data is physically stored and accessed) without affecting the conceptual or external schemas.
